### ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Siddharth Bhatia

I am a second-year PhD student at National University of Singapore and interested in Anomaly Detection. My research, **[MIDAS](https://github.com/Stream-AD/MIDAS/)**, is used to detect intrusions, DoS, and DDoS attacks in real-time in an online manner. It can also be used to detect fake profiles in Social Networks, and Financial Frauds. Currently an Applied Scientist Intern with AI Labs, Amazon Web Services (AWS).

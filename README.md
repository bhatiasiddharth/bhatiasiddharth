### ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I am Siddharth Bhatia, a computer scientist and entrepreneur. I am co-founder and CEO of TurboML, a platform for real-time machine learning.

Previously, I completed my PhD at National University of Singapore and bachelor's at BITS Pilani. My research was supported by the Presidents Graduate Fellowship and I was recognized as a Young Researcher by the ACM Heidelberg Laureate Forum.

During my PhD, I spent wonderful summers interning at Amazon Web Services, and Google Research. I also co-organized the Outlier Detection and Description workshop at KDD which brings together academic and industry researchers, and practitioners to discuss and reflect on outlier mining challenges. Check out my webpage for more details.

I am best reached via email and am always open to interesting conversations and collaboration.

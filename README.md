### ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Siddharth Bhatia

I am a third-year PhD student at National University of Singapore and was recognized as a Young Researcher by the ACM Heidelberg Laureate Forum. My research on **[Streaming Anomaly Detection](https://github.com/Stream-AD/)** is used to detect intrusions and Denial of Service attacks in real-time and streaming manner. It can also be used to detect fake profiles in Social Networks, and Financial Frauds. I previously interned and applied my research at Amazon.

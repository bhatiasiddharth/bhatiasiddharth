### ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Siddharth Bhatia

I am a final-year Ph.D. student at the National University of Singapore (NUS) advised by Bryan Hooi. My research is supported by the Presidents Graduate Fellowship and I was recognized as a Young Researcher by the ACM Heidelberg Laureate Forum. Previously, I received my bachelorâ€™s and masterâ€™s degrees in Computer Science from BITS Pilani, and interned at Amazon and Google Research.

My research in **[Streaming Anomaly Detection](https://github.com/Stream-AD/)** is used for detecting intrusions and denial of service attacks in real-time to minimize the harm caused. One can also detect fake profiles in Social Networks like Twitter, Facebook, Amazon reviews, and Financial Frauds.

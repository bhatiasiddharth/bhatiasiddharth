### ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Siddharth Bhatia

I am a second-year PhD student at National University of Singapore (NUS). My research is in Anomaly Detection. Our algorithm, **[MIDAS](https://github.com/Stream-AD/MIDAS/)**, is used to detect intrusions, DoS, and DDoS attacks in an online manner. It can also be used to detect fake profiles in Social Networks like Twitter, Facebook, Amazon reviews, and Financial Frauds. MIDAS requires constant memory to detect these anomalies in real-time so as to minimize the harm caused by them. Currently an Applied Scientist Intern with AI Labs, Amazon Web Services (AWS).

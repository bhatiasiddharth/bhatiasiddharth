### ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I am Siddharth Bhatia

I am building [TurboML](https://turboml.com/), a machine learning platform reinvented for real-time so that you can manage the complete production ML lifecycle while leveraging real-time data.

Previously, I completed my PhD in [Streaming Anomaly Detection](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2301.13199.pdf) from National University of Singapore (NUS) advised by Bryan Hooi and bachelors at BITS Pilani. My research was supported by the Presidents Graduate Fellowship and I was recognized as a Young Researcher by the ACM Heidelberg Laureate Forum.

During my PhD, I spent wonderful summers interning at Amazon Web Services, and Google Research. I also co-organized the Outlier Detection and Description workshop at KDD which brings together academic and industry researchers, and practitioners to discuss and reflect on outlier mining challenges.

I am best reached via email and am always open to interesting conversations and collaboration.
